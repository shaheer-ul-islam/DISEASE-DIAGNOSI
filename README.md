# Disease Prediction Model

## Introduction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of a disease based on various features. The model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier and evaluated for its accuracy and performance using metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. The dataset includes a 'Disease' column which is encoded, and the outcome variable is predicted based on this encoded data.
